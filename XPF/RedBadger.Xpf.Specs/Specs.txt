CellGroup1 =	Height: Auto | Pixel

If CellGroup3 has no Auto Heights
	Resolve Height Stars
	CellGroup2
	Resolve Width Stars
	CellGroup3

Else If CellGroup2 has NO data
	Resolve Width Stars
	CellGroup3
	Resolve Height Stars
	
Else
	CellGroup2 (force Infinity Height)
	Resolve Width Stars
	CellGroup3
	Resolve Vertical Stars
	CellGroup2 (ignore DesiredWidth)
	
CellGroup4
				
When availbleSize.Width/Height is Positive Infinity, Star behaves the same as Auto
	because there's no explicit width to divide the space up by

------------------------

when arranging a ui Element
	It should throw an exception when the 
		width
		or heigh of the rect is 
		PosInfin or 
		NaN

when arrange has been called
	it should be valid
	it shouldn't be called again
	
when_arrange_gets_called
It should pass the desired size to arrange override

when its got margins
It should pass the desired size minus the margins to arrange override

when the desired size is greater than the available size
it should make the finalSize equal to the desired size


	
	
desired size
if the available < desired
	available = desired

max = Max(desired, max width)

if the max < available
	available = max
